<p>&nbsp &nbsp This website is purely class use. This version is the final product of class project for CIS4301 â€“ database. 
It is created by student Joachim Jones, Jinchi Lin, Kyle Lin, Qian Wang.

<br>
&nbsp &nbspFor this site, we&#39ve decided on storing the geographic and population statistics of cities in our database. 
Specifically, we&#39ll be retrieving the text files from geonames.org pertaining to cities. 
The data are subdivided into three categories: cities with population over one thousand, five thousand,
and fifteen thousand, mutually exclusive. Each city detailed in the data has a unique ID, name,
list of alternate names, latitude, longitude, country, population, elevation, and time zone.
Furthermore, tuples referring to major cities can be extended through use of the landmarks data set that 
provides name, location, and type of notable places sorted by city.
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp We&#39ve decided on this data set because the attributes of cities have a lot of 
interconnectivity and dependencies that are not immediately obvious and cannot be determined through
small scale comparisons. They instead require analysis of large amounts of data and large numbers of
comparisons between attributes. A database is ideal for this task, and proper queries would give answers
to a lot of interesting questions. 
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp Cities have the additional benefit that many of its attributes are both quantitative and hierarchical:
the city with the largest number in the population column has the largest population, the city with
the largest latitude is the furthest north. This allows for easy, valid comparisons within large data sets 
and is very helpful in statistical analysis. In contrast, some data sets (like music) contain attributes like
tone and loudness that are quantitative but have little meaning when compared to others in the data set,
and are more akin to qualitative categorizations.
<br>
&nbsp&nbspThe data set we&#39ll be using is updated with new information and checked for errors frequently, 
and preliminary analysis points toward the formatting being highly structured and amenable to being 
read directly into a database with the right program.
