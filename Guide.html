			<h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Think of a question. Some examples:
            <ul class="questions">
                <li>What's the sum of the populations of all cities in China?</li>
                <li>How many cities have populations over 100,000 and are above 1,000 meters above sea level?</li>
                <li>What is the population of the largest city in each time zone?</li>
                <li>Find all the cities in the United States with populations over 1,000,000</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>
                Determine what attributes you want to know about. For example, if you want to know about all cities in the United States
                with populations over a million, what exactly do you want to know about them? Say that you were most interested in their
                name, population, and elevation. Then, your select section should look like this:<br />
                <img src="image/select.png" class="guide" />
            </p>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>
                Determine what criteria your question has. If you want to know about all cities in the United States with populations over
                a million, your filters are that the city must be in the United States and have a population over a million. Because of that.
                your filter section of the page should look like this:<br />
                <img src="image/filter.png" class="guide" />
            </p>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>
                Click the search button! The table returned should look like this:<br />
                <img src="image/table.png" class="guide" /><br /><br />
                You can sort by clicking on the headings of each column.
